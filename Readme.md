## Motivation:
In disaster zones, especially in developing countries, maps and accessibility information are crucial for crisis response. DeepGlobe Road Extraction Challenge poses the challenge of automatically extracting roads and street networks from satellite images.

## Solution:
We will apply 4 steps for our solution 
### 1. Pre-Processing 

### 2. Feature Extraction
#### 2.1. Using Wavelet 

### 3. Trainning a model 
#### 3.1. Applying Bayesian Statistics 
#### 3.2. 
### 4. Validation
